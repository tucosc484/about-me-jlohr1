## What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?
        I started programming with Java in my Senior year of high school and this is my third year at Towson in the Software Engineering track. I chose this major because that Java class was one of the few lasses I genuinely enjoyed and I can see myself enjoying this career. This class is a required class but I would need to enroll even if it wasn't. I am aware that Javascript, CSS, and HTML are the big three but I have never used them extensively and I would like to. 

## What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?
        I am still unsure of where I want to end up. I just know I enjoy the development of software and if I learned enough to feel like a kind of utility player in the industry I think I would be happy anywhere coding anything.

## What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?
        I have been coding in Java for almost four years. I have had a few short experiences with HTML and Javascript from COSC 109 and a little from my group Software Engineering project.
